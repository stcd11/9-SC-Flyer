- There are many different forms of energy.
- When you pick up a ball, you give it what is known as Gravitational Potential Energy.
- When you drop it, the Gravitational Potential Energy is converted to Kinetic Energy (movement). In other words, the ball falls.
- Other types of energy are:
  1. Electrical Energy
  2. Nuclear Energy
  3. Thermal Energy (Heat)
  4. Light Energy
  5. Chemical Energy (Fuel)
  6. Elastic Potential Energy. 
  7. Sound Energy

- Certain devices can convert one form of energy to another.
  - A solar panel can convert light energy to electrical energy.
  - A wind turbine converts kinetic energy to electrical energy.
  - A fire converts chemical energy to light and heat energy.
- In this project you can use a motor. An eclectic motor can convert electrical energy to kinetic energy.

- Describe the energy conversions that happen in the following systems. Use the web to help you.
  1. A Battery
  2. An LED
  3. A Buzzer
  4. A Dynamo
  5. A Television.

- An electric motor converts, electrical energy into kinetic energy.
- It achieves this by the use of magnets.
- Look at the diagram below.
[[file:img/lorentz.jpg]]
- When an electric current passes through a wire, that is inside a magnetic filed, the wire experiences a force that will move it.
- In the diagram above:
    1. the direction of the magnetic field is from right to left (always N to S).
    2. the direction of the current is going into the screen.
    3. the force on the wire is upwards.

- If the magnetic field direction is switched, or the direction of current is switched, the force on the wire will also be switched.
- Download the image below and then annotate it to show:
  1. the direction of the magnetic field.
  2. the direction of the current (remember that current flows from positive to negative)
  3. The direction of the force(s) on the wire.

- The opposing forces on a loop of current carrying wire, in a magnetic field,  cause the loop to want to turn.
- If we increase the number of loops, so that we have a coil of wire, we can increase the force and so make the coils turn even faster.
- Look at the diagram below. The magnets are almost semi-circles, and there are many coils of wire.

- A set up look this is what is contained in normal electric motors. By attaching the coils of wire to an axle, we can make the axle spin.

- Write up a short summary of how =brushes= work to allow an almost continuous flow of current through the wire coil, inside an electric motor.
- Make sure you include at least one diagram, to help with your explanation.
