** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can.

- You are now going to compete in a knock out drag racing event.
- You will need to record your events and write a report on the events. You will need to use the competition grid from the open drive to track you progress.

- Complete the competition grid of your events with a very basic report of the event.
- Your report will need to include details of the pulley and wheel sizes you chose.

- Complete the competition grid with a basic report of the event
- Your report will include which pulley configurations was best and why(use examples of winning cars in this report).

- Complete the competition grid and write up a detailed events report as before. Include improvements you could make to your designs, a description of the pulleys used by different racers and decide which was best with a detailed explanation.
