** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can.

- The single most important skill of an engineer is to be able to design solutions to new problems, applying their knowledge of electronics, mechanisms and programming to tackle the task at hand. A large number of the exam questions will ask you to design solutions to real-life scenarios, by considering inputs, processes and outputs as well as mechanisms and suitable materials. 
- You will also likely be asked to perform calculations â€“ the formulae for these are all included at the start of the exam paper.
- Questions such as these are difficult to teach. They ask you to look at what you know about electronic components and mechanisms, and to use your creativity to design solutions to unseen problems. To get an idea of how to solve problems like these, there are a set of model solutions [[https://www.bournetoinvent.com/projects/gcse_theory/examples.html][here]], which show some possible solutions.
