<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The single most important skill of an engineer is to be able to design solutions to new problems, applying their knowledge of electronics, mechanisms and programming to tackle the task at hand. A large number of the exam questions will ask you to design solutions to real-life scenarios, by considering inputs, processes and outputs as well as mechanisms and suitable materials. 
</li>
<li>You will also likely be asked to perform calculations â€“ the formulae for these are all included at the start of the exam paper.
</li>
<li>Questions such as these are difficult to teach. They ask you to look at what you know about electronic components and mechanisms, and to use your creativity to design solutions to unseen problems. To get an idea of how to solve problems like these, there are a set of model solutions <a href="https://www.bournetoinvent.com/projects/gcse_theory/examples.html">here</a>, which show some possible solutions.
