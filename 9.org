** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 
* Introduction
** Research
- Before grabbing components and materials, the design of a new product needs to be carefully considered if it is to function as intended when manufactured. Safety is also upmost in a designer’s mind, both at the point of manufacture, and when being used as a finished product.

- When researching a new product, a number of areas might be considered as part of the process:

    - *Existing product analysis:* This is to look at the features, advantages and disadvantages of pre-existing products to see what is currently available. 
    - *Existing solutions:* Looking at how others have solved the problem you’re investigating. 
    - *Materials catalogue:* This will give an indication of what materials are available to build the new product. 
    - *Web site of rival manufacturers:* To get an indication of current design ideas, pricing, mechanisms used, etc.

- Looking at this information may affect your final design by helping to inform the build-cost for the work, the types of mechanisms it will use, the materials it could be made from, or the look/functionality of the product you will design. 
** Design Specification
- When initially setting out a specification for a product, one might consider a number of different issues, such as (in the case of a coffee machine): -

    - *Functionality:* The dispenser in system must be water-resistant to prevent damage.
    - *Safety:* The dispenser should have no exposed wires or sharp corners, to avoid injury.
    - *Power Supply:* The dispenser should run from the mains, so that it won’t consume batteries needlessly and can run all day.
    - *Aesthetic/Appearance:* The system should use neutral colours (e.g. beige and dark grey) so as to blend into an office environment.
    - *Durability:* The machine should be able to withstand minor knocks, as might be expected in an office environment.

*June 2008, Q1.* This question is about the design process. The owner of the theme park has asked you to design an Automated Mascot to welcome visitors to the theme park. (Automate – control or operate automatically)
- (a) Analysis. List two factors that you should think about when designing the Automated Mascot and give a reason why each is important. An example has been given. Example:

/Factor – The likely cost of the whole project./

/Reason – So that it can be built at a reasonable price./

/(4 marks)/

1 (b) Research. The layout of a research plan for the Automated Mascot is shown below. Complete the research plan by adding suitable research sources and stating the information that you would hope to find. The materials section has been completed for you. /(7 marks)/
[[./img/2008_q1b.png]]
1 (c) Describe how the information from the analysis and research may affect the final design. /(2 marks)/

1 (d) Design Specification. Give four design requirements for your Automated Mascot. Example: 

The mascot must welcome visitors

Function: by waving

_Appearance_
- Requirement
- Explanation

_Materials_
- Requirement

_Durability_
- Requirement
- Explanation

/(8 marks)/


*June 2008, Q2.* This question is about design ideas for the system that makes the mascot move. Study the information given in your Design Specification from Question 1. Use this information to sketch two different design ideas for an Automated Mascot for the theme park.

You must show: -
- function
- appearance
- materials
- safety
- durability
- which parts move.

Marks will also be awarded for: -
quality of sketches /(2 marks)/
quality of notes. /(2 marks)/
/(6 marks)/

Evaluate each idea as follows:
- Explain how your design meets the requirements of the specification.
- Function:
- Appearance:
- Materials:

*June 2008, Q3.* This question is about developing the system using mechanisms or pneumatics. Choose one of your ideas for development.
- (a) It was decided that the Automated Mascot should have an electronic sensor to start the movement when a visitor approached it. Using notes and sketches, show clearly how an electronic sensing device could detect a visitor.

- Only show the ‘sensing input’ system for detecting the visitor. Marks will be awarded for:
     - a suitable electronic system to detect a visitor /(4 marks)/
     - quality of sketches and notes describing the operation. /(4 marks)/

- (b) Using notes and sketches, show clearly details of the system that moves the Automated Mascot. Note: -
- The mascot should move continuously
- You should show details of the mechanism and motor
- Show only the moving part of the mascot
- Show the paths of all movement.

Marks will be awarded for: -
