** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 
* Introduction

- To be build a successful Drag racer, you will need to *read* and follow the instructions carefully.
** Wheels
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- building the wheels.
- First cut 2 lengths of 3mm threaded bar. *Make sure you put a nut on each end before cutting*, this will help you fix the thread at the ends you cut by removing the nut.
[[./img/w4img2.jpg]]
- Take the 2 pieces of 3mm threaded bar and the 8 sets of wheels (4 front and 4 back).
- Put a nut on each side of the threaded bar, this will hold the first wheel in place.
[[./img/w4img3.jpg]]
- You now need to place a small amount of PVA glue on each wheel and then use the nuts to tighten them in place while the glue dries.
[[./img/w4img4.jpg]]
[[./img/w4img5.jpg]]
[[./img/w4img6.jpg]]
[[./img/w4img7.jpg]]
- The front wheel does not need gluing together. There is a video on building the front axle below.
** Body
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- Now you will need to glue the axle mounts in place, follow the pictures below.

** Rear Axle and Pulley

- You will now need to remove one of the rear wheels you glued earlier.
[[./img/Rear_axle1.jpg]]
- Then slide the axle through the axle mounts.
[[./img/Rear_axle2.jpg]]
- Now you can place the pulley on the opposite side. *Be sure to place a nut either side of the pulley*, this will tighten up against the pulley and hold it on the axle.
[[./img/Rear_axle3.jpg]]
- Now place the final rear wheel back on and secure the final nut.

** Front Axle Mounts

- The front axle follows a different process.
- First, remove the 2 nuts previously put on the axles.
- Now feed the axle through one side and place a nut on the one end.
[[./img/Front_axle1.jpg]]
- Now slide the wheel between the axle and the hole provided. and place a nut on the other side.
[[./img/Font_axle3.jpg]]
- Now tighten the nut onto either side of the wheel, *ensuring it is in the centre.*
- Now add a 'nylock' nut to either side of the axle mounts.
[[./img/Frontaxle4.jpg]]
- Your completed chassis should now look like this.

- Now put the motor together and mount it to the chassis.
- First, you will need to solder the battery holder to the motor.
[[./img/Soldering.jpg]]
- Now fit the front pulley by pushing them onto the motor. *Place the back of the motor on the table to prevent the rotor pushing through the housing.*
- Make sure the pulley do not touch the motor, or it will not turn.
- You can now cable tie the motor in place.
[[./img/Fitting_motor.jpg]]
- You can now glue the battery box in place.
[[./img/Gluing_battery.jpg]]
** Final Drive and Body
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: build
:END:
- Mount the elastic band and you should have a complete chassis with electrics.
[[./img/Complete.jpg]]
- And fit the aerodynamic cover to test the fit.
[[./img/w4img36.jpg]]
- You will now take home the Drag racer body and decorate as you wish.
